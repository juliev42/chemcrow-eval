Plan the synthesis of an insect repellent.

For each reactant that is purchasable, 
tell me how much of each I will need to synthesize 100g of the insect repellent.

answer = """To synthesize DEET (N,N-diethyl-meta-toluamide), an insect repellent, follow this 1-step synthesis:
1. Add 0.5 mmol of 3-methylbenzoyl chloride (CAS: 1711-06-4) to the reaction vessel.
2. Add 0.3 ml of diethylamine (CAS: 109-89-7) to the reaction vessel, dropwise.
3. Stir the mixture at 25Â°C with normal stirring speed for 24 hours.
4. Concentrate the reaction mixture.
5. Purify the product.
6. Store the final product as DEET (CAS: 134-62-3).
The cost of the reactants is as follows:
- 10.0g of 3-methylbenzoyl chloride cost 5 USD (BLD PHARMATECH LTD CN). 
- 250ml of diethylamine cost 20 USD (Chem-Impex Int'l. Inc).
To synthesize 100g of DEET, you will need:
- 52.35g of 3-methylbenzoyl chloride (0.5 mmol per 191.13g of DEET)
- 31.25ml of diethylamine (0.3 ml per 191.13g of DEET) 
Note: Diethylamine is not known to be explosive. However, 
the explosivity status of 3-methylbenzoyl chloride could not be confirmed. 
Please use caution and consult additional resources before proceeding with the synthesis.
